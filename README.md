# Sun-tracking-solar-panel
This project uses dual LDRs and a servo motor to track sunlight and optimize solar panel orientation. Built with Arduino and expandable via Verilog modules for digital control.

## Features
- Real-time light intensity comparison
- Servo-based panel rotation
- Modular design for hardware expansion

## Folder Structure
- `arduino_sun_tracker/` – Arduino code for LDR-based tracking
- `docs/` – Design notes and schematics

## Getting Started
1. Upload `sun_tracker.ino` to your Arduino
2. Connect LDRs to A0 and A1, servo to D9
3. Power up and watch it track the sun!
